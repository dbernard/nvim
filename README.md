## Setting up

Clone this directory to `~/.config/nvim` and run `./setup.sh`.

## TODO
1. CoC? Maybe just treesitter?
2. Fix tmux on ubuntu (cant find my prompt, prob not a nvim config issue)
3. Customize which_key menu
5. Keybind for maximizing window
6. Fzf should ignore junk (.po files, for example)
7. Recolor python theme (This might be done if I set up treesitter)
8. Hide preview for FZF file finder? It truncates long paths and doesn't seem as useful.
9. Dashboard?
10. Nerd Font compatible font + dev icons? (for fun)
11. Customize nN behavior
